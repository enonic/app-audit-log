# App audit log
Audit log app for enonic xp

The widget shows a log of all events that have happened on an item.

Initial setup needs npm install runned. 
Only one package is installed. 

Oh and add `this.el.append(this.container);` on line 6560 of materialize.js in node_modules ... it did not work properly
